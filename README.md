Some enhancements I have made:

1. Pages layout and styling consistancy: I do so to ensure consistant styles, by naming some container and headings that I want to have same styling with same id or classname so that the global styling can be apply to all.
2. Hamburger menu functionality: to address responsiveness, make sure it works well as intended (showing hamburger menu and hiding nav bar on small screen vice versa for bigger screen).
3. Fix up the look for footer and styling of my link to contact form page: make it look like a pretty button so people want to engage and connect with me.
